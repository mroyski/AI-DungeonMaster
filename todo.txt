Client
- Add ability to create a custom character
- Add friends list and display friends who are connected via web socket
- Tell the DM information about the character who started the game so they don't have to do it manually
- Add ability for new chatters to join the game by sending a message to the DM or clicking a button
- Add view to search available rooms to join

Server
- Save chat history
    - Start with in memory, then move to long term storage (MongoDB?)
- Setup private rooms
    - This rooms will be games with multiple players and player 2 player private chats
- Compress chat history
    - Maybe ChatGPT could send a brief summary of the status of the game in a response to be used on subsuquent requests so the who chat history does not have to be used
    - Maybe we can save the history to the file, and update that file in the OpenAI account to use as context instead of a chat history in API requests?
